										It is just 26 kilometer away from Bandarban sadar. Chimbuk hill is about 2500 feet high above sea level. The road of this area is zigzag. 
										So if you ride in a jeep it will be charming. While your jeep is moving through the various indigenous villages, their simplicity in human gestures will compel you to think about our predecessors struggles to cope with to maintain existence. 
										They are as simple as nature. However when you are looking down from Chimbuk, it will get you the feelings of floating over the clouds. 
										When it is a shiny day, you can see the shades of clouds over the hills. You will also see the beauty of Chimbuk and Nilgiri.
